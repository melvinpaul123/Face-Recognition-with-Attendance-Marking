# Face-Recognition-with-Attendance-Marking
This is a simple, easy to understand program used to recognize faces and mark attendance of those identified.
It can be a useful tool for companies and institutions, automatically marking the attendance of employees or students.
The program will generate an excel file for different section or groups of people with their attendance for different dates when run.
The program uses OpenCV to detect, remember and recognize faces which can be later used to control things like automatic doors, etc and display the information about 
that person thus giving the user a hands-free experience. 

Unzip the rar file before use. Before running the code download the following libraries: 
1.OpenCV 
2.numpy 
3.tkinter
4.pip install face-recognition
5.sqlite3
6.glob
7.datetime
8.openpyxl

I hope this will be usefull to you.
